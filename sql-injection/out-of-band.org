* Intro
Not as common as it either depends on specific features being enabled on the database server or the web application's business logic, which makes some kind of external network call based on the results from an SQL query.

- classified by having 2 different communication channels
   1. to launch the attack
      - a web request
   2. to gather the results
      - monitoring HTTP/DNS requests
* Point from Tryhackme 
1) An attacker makes a request to a website vulnerable to SQL injection with an injeciton payload.
2) The website makes an SQL query to the database which also passes the hacker's paylaod
3) The payload contains a request which forces an HTTP request back to the hacker's machine containing data from the database
