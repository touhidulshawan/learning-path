Used to retrieve data from other tables within the database in SQL

The UNION keyword execute one or more additional ~SELECT~ queries and append the results to the original query

* Determining the number of columns required in SQL injection UNION attack

2 effective methods to determine how many columns are being returned from the original query

1. injecting series of ~ORDER BY~ clause and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs

   #+begin_src sql
     ' ORDER BY 1--
     ' ORDER BY 2--
     ' ORDER BY 3--
     ' ORDER BY 4--
   etc.
   #+end_src

 May give error like *position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list*

   1. Submitting a series of ~UNION SELECT~  payloads specifying a different number of null values:

      #+begin_src sql
      
      #+end_src
