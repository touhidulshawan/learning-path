* Directory Traversal?
Directory traversal aka path traversal a vulnerability that allow an attacker 
- read arbitrary files on the server
- may include code and data, credentials for back-end system, sensitive operating systems files
- allow to modify application data or behavior
- may allow to take full control of the server 
* Reading arbitrary files
Consider a shopping application that displays images of items for sale. Images are loaded via some HTML like 
#+begin_src html
  <img src="/loadImage?filename=image-filename.png">
#+end_src

- loadImage url take a filename and returns the contents of the specified file
- images file stored on disk in server location like ~/var/www/images/~
- application reads from following file path
- ~/var/www/images/image-filename.png~

If  application implements no defense against directory traversal attacks then an attacker can request like following url and retreive an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem
~https://example.com/loadImage?filename=../../~../etc/passwd

So if this execute successfully then an attacker will be able to retrieve the content of the /etc/passwd file.
* Common obstacles
- strips or blocks directory traversal sequences
  - use an absolute path from the filesystem like ~filename=/etc/passwd~
  - use nested traversal sequences like ~....//~ or ~....\/~
- ~multipart/form-data~ request, web-server may strip any directory traversal sequences
  - use url encoding technique to bypass like ~../~ characters resulting in ~%2e%2e%2f~ or ~%252e%252e%252e~
  - non-standard encoding like ~..%c0%af~ or ~..%ef%bc%8f~ may also do the trick
- If it requires filename must end with an expected file extention, like ~.png~ then
  - use null byte to effectively terminate the file path before the required extention
    - ~filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png~
